# Backorder-Prediction
Project Description: Backorder Prediction Model
Overview
The Backorder Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model to accurately forecast product backorders. Backorders are a critical aspect of inventory management, where demand exceeds supply, causing potential delays in product delivery. Efficiently predicting backorders can significantly enhance supply chain operations, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. This project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training/validation, and testing to create a robust prediction system.

Part I: Preprocessing
Dataset Carpentry & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The initial phase involves meticulous data cleaning and preparation, essential for the subsequent analytics process. We focus on:

Data Cleaning: Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and duplicate entries to ensure the quality of the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Develop functions to engineer features that can better represent the underlying patterns related to backorders.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct a thorough analysis to understand the data's characteristics, distribution, and the relationship between different variables. This step is crucial for identifying significant predictors of backorders.
Sampling Strategy:
Given the potentially large volume of data, a smart sampling technique will be employed to create a representative subset. This approach ensures computational efficiency without compromising the model's accuracy.

Part II: Training and Validation
Model Development Pipeline:
The project will explore three alternative pipelines, each incorporating a series of steps designed to optimize the prediction model's performance. These pipelines include:

Anomaly Detection: Implement anomaly detection algorithms to identify and handle outliers that could skew the model's predictions.
Dimensionality Reduction: Apply techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the number of variables, focusing on those that contribute most to predicting backorders.
Classification: Experiment with various classification algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression) to determine the most effective model in predicting backorders.
Each pipeline will be rigorously tested and validated to ensure it meets the project's accuracy and efficiency goals.

Part III: Testing
Model Finalization and Evaluation:

The best-performing model from the validation phase will be trained on the full training dataset to fully leverage the available data.
This model will then be evaluated against the unseen test dataset to assess its real-world applicability and performance.
Project Summary & Model Performance Analysis:

A comprehensive summary will detail the preprocessing steps, the rationale behind the chosen model, and the methodologies employed throughout the project.
An in-depth analysis of the model's performance will be provided, highlighting its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in predicting backorders. Additionally, insights into the model's strengths and limitations will be discussed, alongside recommendations for future improvements.
Conclusion
The Backorder Prediction project is designed to tackle the challenging task of forecasting product backorders using advanced data preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models. By accurately predicting backorders, businesses can proactively manage inventory levels, ensuring that customer demand is met efficiently and cost-effectively.
